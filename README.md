# BLIP Fine-tuning on Flickr8k (CSE 589 Course Project)

This project fine-tunes the BLIP image captioning model (Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) on Flickr8k
and evaluates performance using BLEU. We report results across epochs and include qualitative captions.

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
**# BLIP Fine-tuning on Flickr8k (CSE 589 Course Project)

This project fine-tunes the BLIP image-captioning model (Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base) on the Flickr8k dataset
and evaluates performance using BLEU. Results are reported across multiple epochs and include qualitative examples.

## Contents
- `notebook` : Colab notebook used for fine-tuning and evaluation
- `figures` : qualitative samples, loss curve, BLEU vs epoch, BLEU equation figure
- `results` : CSV tables and qualitative outputs
- `report` : final course project report PDF

## Dataset
Flickr8k is not included in this repository due to size/licensing.  
Place `flickr8k.zip` in Google Drive and run the notebook.

## How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab:
1. Mount Google Drive
2. Set the dataset zip path
3. Run training + evaluation cells
4. Figures and results are saved to Drive

## Notes
The fine-tuned model checkpoint is not uploaded to GitHub because it exceeds size limits.  
It can be regenerated by running the notebook.
